For your hackathon, where students deliver a Jupyter notebook running a stable diffusion model, you can evaluate their work across several dimensions:

### 1. **Technical Implementation (40%)**
   - **Functionality**: Does the notebook run without errors? Does the stable diffusion model generate the expected outputs?
   - **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, modular, and easy to follow? Are there comments that explain key parts of the code?

### 2. **Innovation and Creativity (25%)**
   - **Model Usage**: Have they customized or fine-tuned the stable diffusion model in a novel way?
   - **Problem-Solving**: Did they come up with creative solutions to challenges they encountered (e.g., optimizing results, overcoming limitations of the model)?
   - **Use Case**: How unique and innovative is their application of stable diffusion? Are they tackling an interesting or challenging problem?

### 3. **Data Handling and Preprocessing (15%)**
   - **Data Preparation**: How effectively did they preprocess data (if applicable)? Are data augmentation techniques or transformations used appropriately?
   - **Dataset Relevance**: Is the dataset used relevant to the problem they are solving? Was it chosen carefully or constructed thoughtfully?

### 4. **Results and Evaluation (10%)**
   - **Output Quality**: How visually or contextually accurate are the generated images from the stable diffusion model?

### 5. **Documentation and Presentation (10%)**
   - **Clarity**: Is the notebook well-documented with clear explanations of what each part does.
   - **Presentation**: How well is the work presented overall? Is it easy for others to understand and reproduce their results?

By assigning weights to these categories, you can evaluate both the technical and creative aspects of their work. You might adjust these percentages based on the goals and focus of your hackathon.
