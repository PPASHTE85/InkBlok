Here you can find the dimensions on which the Jupyter notebook will be evaluated.

### 1. **Technical Implementation**
   - **Functionality**: Does the notebook run without errors? Does the stable diffusion model generate the expected outputs?
   - **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, modular, and easy to follow? 

### 2. **Innovation and Creativity**
   - **Model Usage**: Is the stable diffusion model, fine-tuned or customized in a novel way?
   - **Problem-Solving**: Are there any creative solutions to challenges you encountered (e.g., optimizing results, overcoming limitations of the model)?
   - **Use Case**: How unique and innovative is the application of stable diffusion? Are you tackling an interesting or challenging problem?

### 3. **Dataset Creation**
   - **Dataset Relevance**: Is the dataset used relevant to the problem they are solving?

### 4. **Results and Evaluation**
   - **Output Quality**: How visually or contextually accurate are the generated images from the stable diffusion model?

### 5. **Documentation and Presentation**
   - **Clarity**: Is the notebook well-documented with clear explanations of what each part does.
   - **Presentation**: How well is the work presented overall? 

### 6. **Challenges**

Below you can find a list of how to flex your new found powers! 

#### Style Blending
Challenge: Fine-tune the stable diffusion model to merge two distinct styles (e.g., Van Gogh meets Cyberpunk) and generate visually coherent results.

#### Data Augmentation Experimentation
Challenge: Implement creative data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance. For example:
Use synthesized data to train the model.
Show how augmentations affect the output quality or diversity.

#### Thematic Image Generation
Challenge: Generate a series of images based on a specific theme (e.g., futuristic cities, mythical creatures, or surreal dreamscapes). Present the results as a cohesive "art gallery."

#### Explainability and Insights
Challenge: Include visualizations or metrics to explain how fine-tuning affects the model. For example:
Compare the output of the base model versus the fine-tuned model.
Provide insights into the impact of different hyperparameters.

#### Real-World Application
Challenge: Propose a real-world use case where their fine-tuned model could have meaningful impact (e.g., healthcare, education, sustainability) and demonstrate its feasibility with examples.

#### Prompt Engineering Challenge
Challenge: Design and test a variety of creative prompts to push the boundaries of what the model can generate, documenting the most surprising or impressive results.
