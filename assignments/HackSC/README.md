## Introduction

Machine Learning is on fire with the rise of generative AI technologies! 
In this workshop, we'll learn how to fine-tune an image-generation model to create personalized portraits using [Nosana](https://nosana.com/), a decentralized GPU provider specialized for AI inferencing.

In this guide we will be going through how to use a Stable Diffusion model.
We'll be doing this by running it on a Jupyter Notebook.

What's a Jupyter Notebook you might ask?

> Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as IPython Notebook) is an interactive web application for creating and sharing computational documents.

But for something with a bit more meat, take a look at this actual [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html)
As you can see there are cells, filled with either text, shell commands or code.
This let's you go through the step by step guide to learn the steps needed to build and run a stable Diffusion model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Python and Machine Learning concepts.
- [Telegram (Required)](https://telegram.org/)
