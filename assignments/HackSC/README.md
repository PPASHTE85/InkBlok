## Generate Your Self-Portrait: Building Custom Image-Generation Models with Nosana

![Nosana Logo](https://nosana.com/img/logotype.svg)

Welcome to the repository for the **"AI Avatar Generator"** workshop at HackSC! 
This workshop guides you through using an image-generation machine learning model using Nosana's decentralized GPU platform. 
In the end you will have a Jupyter Notebook, that will guide you through how to use your own Stable Diffusion model.
You'll be able to run inferences with your model and generate images with it.

## Introduction

Machine Learning is on fire with the rise of generative AI technologies! 
In this workshop, we'll learn how to fine-tune an image-generation model to create personalized portraits using [Nosana](https://nosana.com/), a decentralized GPU provider specialized for AI inferencing.

In this guide we will be going through how to use a Stable Diffusion model.
We'll be doing this by running it on a Jupyter Notebook.

What's a Jupyter Notebook you might ask?

> Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as IPython Notebook) is an interactive web application for creating and sharing computational documents.

But for something with a bit more meat, take a look at this actual [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html)
As you can see there are cells, filled with either text, shell commands or code.
This let's you go through the step by step guide to learn the steps needed to build and run a stable Diffusion model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Python and Machine Learning concepts.
- [Hugging Face Account](https://huggingface.co/)
- [Python (optional)](https://www.python.org/)
- [Jupyter Lab (optional)](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started

### Hugging Face

Let's get started by creating an account on Hugging Face.
You'll need this later for when we need to sign a form to use one of the [stable diffusion models](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers) hosted on Huggin Face.

### Python



## Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues:**
  - *Jupyter Notebook won't start:* Ensure Nosana CLI is installed and configured correctly.
  - *Module not found errors:* Double-check that all dependencies are installed.
- **Getting Help:**
  - Open an issue on this repository.
  - Reach out on [Nosana's Discord HackSC Channel](https://discord.com/channels/236263424676331521/1303396409277546568).


## Acknowledgments

- **Nosana Team** for providing the platform and support.
- **HackSC Organizers** for hosting the event.
- **Participants** for their enthusiasm and creativity.

### Additional Tips

- **Visuals:** Add screenshots or GIFs of the web application to the README to make it more engaging.
- **Links:** Ensure all links (e.g., to Nosana, Solana, and other resources) are active and point to the correct pages.
- **Instructions Clarity:** Test the instructions yourself or have someone else follow them to ensure they are clear and complete.
- **Updating the README:** As the project evolves, keep the README updated to reflect any changes.
